# Codsoft Internship in Python Programming

## Introduction

Welcome to my Codsoft internship in Python programming! During this internship, I successfully completed several projects to showcase my skills and proficiency in Python. These projects include a Calculator, Weather Forecast Application, Password Generator, and a Todo Application.

## Projects

### 1. Calculator

- **Description:** I developed a versatile calculator application that can perform various mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- **Features:** 
  - Basic arithmetic calculations
  - Support for parentheses for complex expressions
  - User-friendly interface for input and output
- **How to Run:** To use the calculator, simply run the `calculator.py` script.

### 2. Weather Forecast Application

- **Description:** I created a weather forecast application that provides up-to-date weather information for a specified location.
- **Features:** 
  - Fetches weather data from an API
  - Displays current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more
  - User-friendly command-line interface
- **How to Run:** Run the `weather_forecast.py` script and follow the prompts to enter the location you want to check the weather for.

### 3. Password Generator

- **Description:** I designed a password generator to help users create strong and secure passwords.
- **Features:** 
  - Generates random passwords with specified length
  - Customizable options, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Generates unique passwords on each run
- **How to Run:** Execute the `password_generator.py` script, and it will guide you through the password generation process.

### 4. Todo Application

- **Description:** I built a simple yet effective todo application to help users manage their tasks and to-dos.
- **Features:** 
  - Add, remove, and list tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Store tasks in a text file for persistence
- **How to Run:** Run the `todo_app.py` script to start managing your tasks. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.

## Conclusion

I am delighted to have had the opportunity to complete these projects as part of my Codsoft internship. These projects have enhanced my Python programming skills and have given me practical experience in developing real-world applications.
